This is a fundamental difference from point measurement methods that employ probes to measure the flow velocity at a single point. A main advantage of PIV is that it is a quantitative flow field mapping technique that can provide physical insight into the overall flow behavior in question. PIV facilitates both the extraction of measurement data and the visualization of flow structures. An application-oriented introduction of planar PIV is provided with two case studies included to familiarize users with the PIV system.},

As an imaging technique, the value of modern infrared thermography is its ability to produce a digitized image or high speed video rendering a thermal map of the scene in false colour. Since temperature is an important environmental parameter influencing animal physiology and metabolic heat production an energetically expensive process, measuring temperature and energy exchange in animals is critical to understanding physiology, especially under field conditions. As a non-contact approach, infrared thermography provides a non-invasive complement to physiological data gathering. One caveat, however, is that only surface temperatures are measured, which guides much research to those thermal events occurring at the skin and insulating regions of the body. As an imaging technique, infrared thermal imaging is also subject to certain uncertainties that require physical modelling, which is typically done via built-in software approaches. Infrared thermal imaging has enabled different insights into the comparative physiology of phenomena ranging from thermogenesis, peripheral blood flow adjustments, evaporative cooling, and to respiratory physiology. In this review, I provide background and guidelines for the use of thermal imaging, primarily aimed at field physiologists and biologists interested in thermal biology. I also discuss some of the better known approaches and discoveries revealed from using thermal imaging with the objective of encouraging more quantitative assessment.},

   abstract = {As the demand for electricity generated through renewable energy continue to grow, it is essential to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of technologies such as Photovoltaic (PV) Module. Currently, household PV modules only inhabit an efficiency of 17% and this efficiency degrades by 0.3% for every degree Celsius above 25℃, its longevity is also shortened by the heat accumulations. To tackle these limitations, attaching Vortex Generators (VGs) to the rear surface of the module was found to be an effective way to promote cooling on the module. This thesis investigates the enhancement of convective heat flux on photovoltaic modules through experimental testing, utilising an array of cylindrical vortex generators (VGs) attached to the rear surface of the module. The objective is to determine the optimal spacing of the VG array that maximizes cooling efficiency. The testing was conducted in a Large Wind Tunnel (LWT) to simulate wind speed of 1m/s, 1.3m/s, 2m/s, 2.3m/s, 3m/s and 3.3m/s. 5 different spacing cases for each array direction (spanwise & streamwise) were assessed.


Experimental results showed that cooling effects varied depending on the spacing of the cylindrical VG array in both spanwise and streamwise directions. The 51mm spacing arrangement in spanwise direction provided best cooling performance of 2.15 ℃ under speed of 3.3 m/s. On the other hand, 79mm spacing arrangement in streamwise direction produced highest cooling effect at 2.51 ℃ under 3m/s windspeed. Between the two spacing parameters, it was found that streamwise spacing appears to have more significant impact on VG array cooling performance as some extreme streamwise spacing cases resulted in heating up the module. The significance of these findings contributes to the efforts of researching of ways to reduce PV module waste by extending its lifespan and as well as improving the overall conversion efficiency of the solar energy system.},

The PV module was tested in a Large Wind Tunnel (LWT) at speeds of 1, 2, and 3 m/s.

Observations from the experiments indicated that the cooling and heating effects varied depending on the VG shape. The Winglet β150 VG shape achieved a cooling effect of 5.123°C at 1 m/s, while the pyramid-inverted VG shape resulted in a heating effect, increasing the panel temperature by 2.569°C at 1 m/s. 

Among the five VG shapes tested, the cylindrical VG shape showed the most promising results, with the greatest cooling effect trend as wind speed increased. Therefore, this VG shape was selected for further experimentation with spacing cases to achieve turbulent flow in the spanwise direction.},

The efficient use of natural wind for cooling is a low-cost alternative compared with the use of artificial cooling devices. In this study, a passive cooling scheme is proposed including components: curved eave and vortex generators (VGs) which is arranged on the roof to enhance the forced convective heat exchange and reduce temperature of rooftop PV module under prevailing wind conditions. The optimum arrangement of VGs was studied, temperature reduction and PCE of rooftop PV with the scheme were evaluated. The results show that the curved eaves installed on the flat-roof leading edge improved the convective heat exchange only in the airflow separation area. And the defect that surface convective heat exchange decreased along with the flow direction was improved when multi-row array VGs were arranged. The overall convective heat exchange on rooftop PV can be improved at a wide range of wind speed by scheme using curved eaves in combination with the symmetrically arranged VGs. After using the passive cooling scheme, the ratio of forced convective heat exchange on the rooftop PV upper surface to 60%, and the maximum temperature reduction is about 5.89 ℃, and PCE of PV is improved in summer. The low-cost passive cooling scheme proposed in this paper is expected to be applied to the new-built and reconstruction of flat-roof mounted PV system.},

Problems of flame stabilizers and of fuel sprays may be mentioned as examples. Experience has proved that the three-dimensional flow processes are often controlled by two-dimensional vortex patterns. Thus, the vortex street is in many places considered a research theme that proceeds from special questions but may lead to the most far-reaching conclusions.

The sole objective of this review is to gather major thermodynamic features of CHXs presented by researchers through both experimental and numerical investigation for innovative designing purpose of heat exchangers. We have evaluated the effects of different types of vortex generators, their arrangement, location, attack angles and height on heat transfer and friction characteristics of heat exchangers. It was noticed that longitudinal vortices induced by vortex generators leads to the reduction of wake region behind tubes, augmentation of turbulence intensity and higher flow mixing. However, the intensity and strength of these vortices is strictly dependent on Reynold number. Delta winglet type vortex generators provide better heat transfer performance than rectangular winglet type vortex generators. Location of these winglets is quite suitable in downstream region than upstream region.

Therefore, the refrigeration research could not keep itself away from the ever-rising horizon of nanofluid applications.

Looking to industrial applications, nanofluid long-term stability and reusability are crucial requisites. Nanoparticles’ deposits induce microchannel circuit obstruction, limiting the proper functioning of the device and negating the beneficial characteristics of the nanofluid. The aggregation and sedimentation of the particles may also determine the increased viscosity and pumping cost, and reduced thermal properties. So, there is a need to address the features of nanofluid starting from realization, evaluation, stabilization methods, and operational aspects. In this review, investigations of nanorefrigerants are summarized. In particular, a description of the preparation procedures of nanofluids was reported, followed by a deep elucidation of the mechanism of nanofluid destabilization and sedimentation, and finally, the literature results in this field were reviewed.},

However, this heightened need for energy has raised concerns about its impact on the environment and the rising costs associated with it. Therefore, the engineering sector is actively seeking sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions. Among the promising innovations in solving the problem is the photovoltaic thermal system (PVT), which aims to capture electrical and thermal energy from solar radiation. Despite its potential, the application of PVT systems is currently limited due to the unpredictable nature of solar energy and the absence of efficient thermal energy storage capabilities. To address these challenges, researchers have explored the use of phase change materials and nano-improved phase change materials (NEPCMs) to optimize energy extraction from solar systems. By incorporating these materials, the PVT system can maximize energy utilization. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the potential applications of PVT techniques in both industrial and building settings. It also offers a detailed assessment of their commercial and environmental aspects. The research findings highlight several advantages of PVT systems, including reduced electricity consumption, efficient utilization of cooling and heating loads during off-peak periods, improved temperature stability, and enhanced thermal comfort. Furthermore, the integration of NEPCMs in PVT systems has demonstrated superior thermal performance, enabling 8.3% more heat energy storage during charging and 25.1% more heat energy release during discharging. Additionally, the implementation of solar-assisted combined heating and power systems showed the potential to prevent the emission of 911 tons of CO2 per year compared to conventional PV systems. These systems offer a promising pathway towards mitigating environmental impacts while meeting energy demands. Overall, this review article serves as a valuable resource for fellow researchers by providing detailed insights into the viability of PVT systems for various applications in the industrial and building sectors.},

Elevated temperatures on the back surface of photovoltaic panels pose a challenge, potentially reducing electrical output and overall efficiency. To address this, a cooling system employing water spray and air was proposed and examined across three scenarios. Results show a consistent reduction in panel temperature with the implemented cooling systems. The drop in temperature of 24°C (40%) and increase in the output power of 13% indicates its effectiveness, with peak efficiency observed during high ambient temperatures. When water cooling was used, the percentage drop in temperature ranged from approximately 20.5% to 35.4%. The air-cooling system achieves a percentage drop in temperature, ranging from approximately 6 to 26%. Hybrid cooling proves most effective in substantially reducing panel temperature compared to water or air alone. A detailed examination of output power reveals consistent and significant increases with cooling throughout the day. A significant higher percentage power increase is achieved during peak solar radiation hours highlighting the effectiveness of the system during intense sunlight exposure. The cumulative effect reinforces the practical significance of the cooling system, showing its potential to enhance daily energy yield. Efficiency trends consistently indicate higher efficiency with cooling compared to without cooling. The hybrid system, which appears as a promising solution for diverse environmental conditions cases, improves the overall efficiency by up to 2%.},

The cooling was conducted using an insulated channel installed below a PV panel. Natural convection cooling was investigated for various channel air gaps (H = 30, 60, 90, and 120 mm). Natural convection currents in the cooling channels were capable of cooling the panel with wide air gaps. In forced convection cooling, the air was introduced by fans installed at the bottom opening of the cooling channel with various air velocities (ua = 1, 2, and 3 m/s). Evaporative natural convection cooling was performed by a wetted fabric along the lower surface of the cooling channel, whereas evaporative forced convection cooling by pushing air along the wetted lower surface of the channel. The experimental data showed that the panel efficiency and output increased due to cooling. The experimental results of natural convection cooling revealed that the use of an air gap of 120 mm to cool the solar panel contributed to an increase in the panel daily energy production and efficiency by 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively. For forced convection cooling, using air at a speed of 3 m/s increased the daily energy production by 4.4% and the efficiency by 4%. Natural convection evaporative cooling increased the daily energy production and the efficiency by 3.6% and 2.7%, respectively.

   abstract = {Changes in the tilt angle technically affect the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface of panels. Specific to PV/PCM system, where PCM is employed as passive cooling methods for the PV cells, these changes could affect the melting performance of the PCM and subsequently the overall performance of the PV cells. This novel study presents a numerical and experimental analysis to access the effect of tilt angle on the characteristics of the melting process of PCM-based as heat sink inside the PV cells backside rectangular container and its potential used for thermal management of the PV cells. While numerous literature on the numerical modeling of this system focused their attention on the vertical angle, four different tilt angles (0°, 30°, 60°, and 90°) are considered in this study. Excellent agreement was seen between the results obtained from experiments and numerical simulations. The results show that as the tilt-angle of PV/PCM system increases from 0° to 90°, the melting process time of PCM decreases which leads to decrease in overall PV cell temperature from −0.4% to −12%. In conclusion, PCM shows minimal cooling performance at a lower tilt angle due to the role of natural convection heat transfer inside PCM container which acts as a passive cooling mechanism.},

   abstract = {Recent research on cooling solar cells through the radiative cooling method has elicited much interest. Compared with bare silicon solar cells, modified cells with enhanced radiative cooling can reduce temperature by over 10 °C, thereby improving the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of solar cells. At present, the commercial silicon photovoltaic (PV) module is the mainstream product for PV application. Thus, investigating the effect of enhanced radiative cooling on cooling solar cells based on a commercial PV module is imperative. In this study, the effect of enhanced radiative cooling on solar cells based on a commercial PV module was explored, and the application prospect was analyzed preliminarily. A sample of PV module (referred to as “commercial structure” hereinafter) was fabricated by encapsulating a bare crystalline silicon cell with glass. The spectral property of the commercial structure was modified by adding a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film on its top surface; this structure is referred to as “modified structure” hereinafter. A comparative experiment was conducted, and results showed that the solar cell temperatures in the commercial and modified structures were almost consistent. The effects of enhanced radiative cooling on the PV module under different conditions were also analyzed theoretically through a universal mathematical model. Simulation results revealed that the solar cell temperature could only be reduced by 1.75 K even in the ideal case. Experimental and simulation results indicated that enhanced radiative cooling based on a PV module shows no specific potential for cooling solar cells in actual settings. The performance of enhanced radiative cooling for solar cells in an extraterrestrial environment was also discussed preliminarily, and the results showed that radiative cooling can be applied as an alternative method for the thermal management of solar cells in the extraterrestrial environment.},

The uniqueness of this research lies in the utilization of multidirectional fins with varying heights, which effectively accelerate heat transfer in PV cooling systems by inducing a transition in the boundary layer within the confined zone of the fins. The research aims to investigate the effect of using Multidirectional Tapered Fin Heat Sinks (MTFHS) to improve the efficiency of PV modules by utilizing aluminum alloy material as heatsinks. The proposed multidirectional design aims to facilitate enhanced heat transfer by promoting airflow in the central area of the PV module. The experimental procedures in our study differ from previous research as we utilized the latest generation of PV modules (405 Wp, PERC Half-cut cells) to fill the discrepancy between laboratory-based investigations and practical applications. Two PV modules were tested for an outdoor parametric analysis under outdoor operating conditions, with solar irradiance recorded from 200 to 1000 W/m2 and ambient temperatures ranging from 26° to 38 °C. Findings indicated that the proposed MTFHS could lower PV module temperatures by 12 ⁰C. Reduced temperature boosts PV module efficiency by 1.53%.

The rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves as well as their adverse environmental impact heighten the quest for cleaner and sustainable energy resources to generate electricity. Solar energy is an unlimited and immeasurable source of renewable energy that is used for direct electricity production through the solar PV cell. However, environmental conditions as well as operation and maintenance of the solar PV cell affect the optimum output and substantially impact the energy conversion efficiency, productivity and lifetime, thus affect the economy of power generation. In this study, an investigation about recent works regarding the effect of environmental and operational factors on the performance of solar PV cell is presented. It is found that dust allocation and soiling effect are crucial, along with the humidity and temperature that largely affect the performance of PV module. Additionally, the wind itself carries a significant amount of dust and sand particles, especially in the deserted areas. Deposition of dust in humid conditions forms adhesive, sticky mud on the PV cell and worsens the situation as it reduces the power generation up to 60–70%. This study discusses advanced approaches to mitigate the effects of these factors with their relative merits and challenges. Finally, a guideline is proposed to minimize the effect of different environmental and operational factors to optimize the performance of solar PV cell.},

   abstract = {In order to obtain the Boron profile in Silicon substrate the signal S,(S) given by the probe and related to the Boron impurity in the sample is compared to the signal S,(C) related to the Boron in a Silicon check-sample with a known impurity profile. The density C,(S) of Boron in the sample is given by [4]: where C,(C), S,,(C) and S,,(S) are respectively the impurity density in the check-sample and the signal related to the Silicon atoms in both the check-sample and the studied device. The Boron profile in the Silicon as given by relation (I) is shown in Fig. 2, which shows good agreement between experiment and the two types of theoretical results in the upper part of the profile. The poor agreement observed at a slow concentration between experimental results and the results of SUPREM can be attributed to the exponential term empirically introduced in the SUPREM program to account for the chanttelling effect[3]. Indeed when the Silicon substrate is covered by a SiOz layer the impinging Boron ions have randomly distributed directions when they reach the SiOz-Si interface. Consequently the probability of channeling for these ions is very low. On the other hand agreement with Furukawa's theory is not surprising since it does not consider the channeling effect. As far as the impurity profile in the Silicon dioxide is concerned relation (I) will nqt gply because the Si atoms concentration C,,(C) in the check-sample is different from C,,(S) in the SiOr layer. In this case it can be easily shown that the impurity concentration is given by: c,(s) = cr(c) &(C) C~i(s)~,~~, _._ ._ s!(O US) CC(C) (2) where the C,,(S)/C,,(C) ratio can be calculated from the molecular weight and the density of the two species and is equal to 0.45. hinted in Great Britain. Under these conditions the implanted Boron profile as given by relation (2) is also represented in Fig. 2 which shows good agreement between both theoretical and experimental results. The high concentration observed near the SiOz surface in disagreement with the two theories is fictive and caused by an exaltation phenomenon of the ionizing probe signal at the start of ionic analysis [4]. As a summary both Furukawa's and SUPREM theories give satisfactory agreement with etperimental results in the SiOr layer and in the underlaying Silicon. However it can be noticed that SUPREM program does not account for the deeper region of the profile and this can be caused by a lack of channeling effect in presence of the SiOr layer.

The operating temperature plays a key role in the photovoltaic conversion process. Both the electrical efficiency and the power output of a photovoltaic (PV) module depend linearly on the operating temperature. The various correlations proposed in the literature represent simplified working equations which can be apply to PV modules or PV arrays mounted on free-standing frames, PV-Thermal collectors, and building integrated photovoltaic arrays, respectively. The electrical performance is primarily influenced by the material of PV used. Numerous correlations for cell temperature which have appeared in the literature involve basic environmental variables and numerical parameters which are material or system dependent. In this paper, a brief discussion is presented regarding the operating temperature of one-sun commercial grade silicon-based solar cells/modules and its effect upon the electrical performance of photovoltaic installations. Generally, the performance ratio decreases with latitude because of temperature. However, regions with high altitude have higher performance ratios due to low temperature, like, southern Andes, Himalaya region, and Antarctica. PV modules with less sensitivity to temperature are preferable for the high temperature regions and more responsive to temperature will be more effective in the low temperature regions. The geographical distribution of photovoltaic energy potential considering the effect of irradiation and ambient temperature on PV system performance is considered. © 2011 The Authors.},

   abstract = {In order to find an upper theoretical limit for the efficiency of p-n junction solar energy converters, a limiting efficiency, called the detailed balance limit of efficiency, has been calculated for an ideal case in which the only recombination mechanism of hole-electron pairs is radiative as required by the principle of detailed balance. The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction fc of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30% for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1. Actual junctions do not obey the predicted current-voltage relationship, and reasons for the difference and its relevance to efficiency are discussed.},

   abstract = {In this article, lensless Fourier transform digital holographic interferometry (LLFTDHI) is presented for the investigation of heat transfer parameters such as natural convective heat transfer coefficient and local heat flux around the surface of heated wire, visual and quantitative demonstration of heat flow performances of heat sinks, temperature distribution in laminar free convective flow of liquids, and temperature measurement of human hand skin. Investigations about the temperature distribution inside the macro and micro diffusion flames as well as the study of magnetic promotion of combustion in micro diffusion flame is also presented. Advantages of using LLFT configuration of DH are as follows: 1. Image reconstruction in this geometry of DH is faster in comparison with other reconstruction methods such as Fresnel approximation and convolution approach, because in LLFTDH, Fourier transform of only recorded digital hologram is evaluated apart from some multiplicative constant, while other reconstruction methods require several FT and complex multiplication; 2. This geometry provide improved lateral resolution in the reconstructed image because entire spatial bandwidth can be utilized for complete evaluation of information from sensor by optimizing the ratio of object size and distance between object and sensor. There are some limitations of using LLFTDH. Image planes at different axial depths cannot reconstructed (i.e. digital focusing is not possible) in LLFTDH. So LLFTDH technique is not useful for applications particularly where concentrations of particles and its distribution is to be determined in 3D volume. Other limitation of LLFTDH is that it is off-axis holography so reconstruction plane has zero order term and conjugate image while in phase shifting DH provides better image quality in reconstruction because of the absence of zero-order and conjugate image. Better image reconstruction in phase shifting DH is achieved at the cost of high technical efforts: three or four phase shifted interferograms are required restricting the technique to study slowly varying phenomena.},

   abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a prominent material for radiative cooling due to its promising optical properties in the mid-infrared spectral region as well as its fabrication easiness. Even though several works have reported that the mid-infrared emissivity of a PDMS film can be increased by surface modification, there is still room for further enhancement through global optimization. Here, we designed and fabricated the thin PDMS film patterned with two-dimensional gratings to obtain the highest emissivity in the wavelength range from 8 to 13 microns. A surrogate-model-based optimization was performed, and the optimum structure exhibited the averaged emissivity value of 0.99 in the wavelength of 8–13 microns, which is the highest value reported to date among polymer-based radiative coolers. For real-world applications, we also developed the fabrication method that is repeatable and applicable for various surfaces using a flexible master mold.},

Coriolis and thermal mass flow meters for mass flow measurement in liquid and gas are most significant. For each type and category of meter, pros and cons in various applications are covered to facilitate meter selection from the various meters available in the market. Real-life issues, including various operating conditions, environmental conditions, and available performances of meters are covered. In order to facilitate system design, specification sheets for the meters have been included. From basic Coriolis principles, comprehensive details, which include but are not limited to the theoretical and mathematical backgrounds for metering systems, etc. are described. The discussions also include specific requirements for Coriolis meter installation, pressure loss sizing, and calibration and zero stability. In addition to Coriolis, other mechanical mass flow measurements, e.g., twin-turbine mass flow meters are described. In thermal mass flow, both bypass capillary design and thermal dispersion meters are covered, with special reference to industrial use and semiconductor use. For both types of meters the theoretical background and mathematical formulation process are detailed. Installation details, selection, and calibration processes for these meters are also covered with detailed coverage of their advantages and disadvantages.},

   abstract = {Reducing the operation temperature of photovoltaic (PV) modules will allow prolonging their service time and energy output. This work investigated a passive PV module cooling technique by attaching vortex generators (VGs) on the rear surface of PV modules. The rectangular wing VGs of size 2 × 3 cm, are made from aluminium sheet (Al VG) or 3D printed thermally conductive polymer (Poly VG). After ten months of data collection on an open rack system, we have gained insight into the wind speed- and direction-dependent performance of the Al and Poly VGs. The pronounced difference in thermal conductivity of the two materials helps distinguish cooling due to vortex generation, predominant at low wind speeds, from the heat sink effect, prevalent at higher wind speeds. Despite being optimised for free convection, both VGs demonstrated 1.5 °C of cooling under low wind and high irradiance, while Al VGs provided 2.5 °C of cooling under high module temperature and windy scenarios. Both VGs exhibit equivalent performance with south and west winds, indicating the dominance of the vortex generation mechanism. The module equipped with VGs exhibited an increase in convective heat transfer coefficient as evaluated by the thermal balance model.},

abstract = {In this study, additive manufacturing or three dimensional (3D) printing technology was utilized to develop thermal and acoustic insulation materials. A 3D model was carefully designed to obtain thermal and acoustic insulation properties using Autodesk software and print the materials using QIDI X-PLUS 3D printer with precise and controlled shape and structure. Biodegradable PLA filament was used as printing ink. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to check whether this new branch of technology is suitable for producing insulation materials. Testing results revealed that insulation materials produced from 3D printing technology have excellent thermal and acoustic insulation properties. The lowest obtained thermal conductivity value was 0.037 W/mK, and the maximum obtained sound transmission loss was 48.27 dB at 1600 Hz frequency. In case of physical properties, density of insulation panels ranges from 366.46 to 721.26 kg/m3, and porosity ranges from 43 to 71%. Life cycle cost (LCC) analysis was carried out to obtain the optimum insulation thickness, energy savings, and payback period of developed insulation materials for different locations in the USA. It was found that the optimum insulation thickness varies between 4 and 10 mm, energy savings varies between 45.0% and 67.2%, and payback period varies between 8.5 and 14.8 years. The effect of structural parameters (thickness, density, air permeability, and porosity) on insulation properties was also checked in order to obtain a relationship between structural parameters and insulation properties. It was found that both density and porosity have significant influence on insulation properties. Testing results also revealed that thermal and acoustic insulation properties follow opposite trends with the increase of density and porosity. The increase in density and decrease in porosity causes increase in acoustic insulation property, but decrease in thermal insulation property. A comparison was also made with commercially available acoustic and thermal insulation panels, and it was observed that produced 3D printed samples have better insulation properties. This indicates that developed materials have very good potential to be commercially used as building insulation materials. As produced insulation material has colored and glossy surfaces, it can be used in the interior or exterior of building walls and may also replace plasterboard or tiles of building walls.}
